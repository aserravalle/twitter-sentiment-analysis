        "Today I'm going to teach you some less conventional applications of Python. Not the neural networks and data analysis that you typically find in these sorts of workshops. I feel like those useful things are overrated, so I'm going to teach you something truly shit. Something you're never going to use in data analytics, but you're going to learn how to do it anyway. I will do my best to make it interesting and engaging, and because I'm so good at that you will probably remember this. You'll sit your next exam, completely forget how to do all the important things like regression and classification. But you'll know how to use python to figure out how Japanese people feel about McDonalds.\n",

You can't edit code collaboratively like you can edit a word doc on Google Drive, but you can access it anywhere you can access google drive, and share it the same way. The only annoying thing about it is the way you upload files to it - which I'll leave for you to figure out in your own time. Today, everything we need comes from the internet.\n",

What this first line of code means is that you will enter the `textblob` library, which should be readily available in your instance of Google Colab. This means you can just use `from/import`, instead of having to use Python Installation Packages like you do on your home terminal. PIP install isn't actually that hard in theory, but you can have issues with your operating system and python version that I don't want to deal with because I'd like you all to follow along.\n",

The first is polarity - which ranges from -1 (very negative) to +1 (very positive). The second is subjectivity, which ranges from 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective). "
